scrapy based brooksbasell.net(ex:http://www.brooksbaseball.net/h_tabs.php?player=405395&balls=-1&strikes=-1&b_hand=-1&time=month&minmax=ci&var=ra&s_type=2&gFilt=&startDate=&endDate=) parser built for my friend Brad

To run, move into topmost bradBallz and run:
1.scrapy crawl brooksbaseball -a inFile=namesToCheckAgainst.csv #crawls urls provided in inFile
2.python getNamesToCkeckAgainst.py #fetches and properly parses a playerlist from https://crunchtimebaseball.com/master.csv, resulting in inFile
3.sh runAll.sh #runs 2 then 1 and outputs helpful metadata

crawling will produce leftOut.csv, rightOut.csv, bothOut.csv. These are like the csv in example.png and the filename signifies which hand the data is reported for
